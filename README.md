## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they struggle with complex features:

- **Context overload** — Long conversations lead to compression, lost details, hallucinations
- **No structure** — "Build me dark mode" produces unpredictable results
- **No review gate** — Code gets written before anyone agrees on what to build
- **No memory** — Specs live in chat history that vanishes

## The Solution

**Agent Teams Lite** is an agent-team orchestration pattern where a lightweight coordinator delegates all real work to specialized sub-agents. Each sub-agent starts with fresh context, executes one focused task, and returns a structured result.

```
YOU: "I want to add CSV export to the app"

ORCHESTRATOR (delegate-only, minimal context):
  → launches EXPLORER sub-agent     → returns: codebase analysis
  → shows you summary, you approve
  → launches PROPOSER sub-agent     → returns: proposal artifact
  → launches SPEC WRITER sub-agent  → returns: spec artifact
  → launches DESIGNER sub-agent     → returns: design artifact
  → launches TASK PLANNER sub-agent → returns: tasks artifact
  → shows you everything, you approve
  → launches IMPLEMENTER sub-agent  → returns: code written, tasks checked off
  → launches VERIFIER sub-agent     → returns: verification artifact
  → launches ARCHIVER sub-agent     → returns: change closed
```

**The key insight**: the orchestrator NEVER does phase work directly. It only coordinates sub-agents, tracks state, and synthesizes summaries. This keeps the main thread small and stable.

### Persistence Is Pluggable

The workflow engine is storage-agnostic. Artifacts can be persisted in:

- `engram` (recommended default) — https://github.com/gentleman-programming/engram
- `openspec` (file-based, optional)
- `none` (ephemeral, no persistence)

Default policy is conservative:

- If Engram is available, persist to Engram (recommended)
- If user explicitly asks for file artifacts, use `openspec`
- Otherwise use `none` (no writes)
- `openspec` is NEVER chosen automatically — only when the user explicitly asks

### Quick Modes

Recommended defaults by use case:

```yaml
# Agent-team storage policy
artifact_store:
  mode: engram      # Recommended: persistent, repo-clean
```

```yaml
# Privacy/local-only (no persistence)
artifact_store:
  mode: none
```

```yaml
# File artifacts in project (OpenSpec flow)
artifact_store:
  mode: openspec
```

               close change)
```

### Sub-Agent Result Contract

Each sub-agent should return a structured payload with variable depth:

```json
{
  "status": "ok | warning | blocked | failed",
  "executive_summary": "short decision-grade summary",
  "detailed_report": "optional long-form analysis when needed",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "name": "design",
      "store": "engram | openspec | none",
      "ref": "observation-id | file-path | null"
    }
  ],
  "next_recommended": ["tasks"],
  "risks": ["optional risk list"]
}
```

`executive_summary` is intentionally short. `detailed_report` can be as long as needed for complex architecture work.

### Artifact Persistence (Optional)

When `openspec` mode is enabled, a change can produce a self-contained folder:

```
openspec/
├── config.yaml                        ← Project context (stack, conventions)
├── specs/                             ← Source of truth: how the system works TODAY
│   ├── auth/spec.md
│   ├── export/spec.md
│   └── ui/spec.md
└── changes/
    ├── add-csv-export/                ← Active change

    │   ├── specs/                     ← Delta specs (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)
    │   │   └── export/spec.md
    │   ├── design.md                  ← HOW (architecture decisions)
    │   └── tasks.md                   ← WHAT (implementation checklist)
    └── archive/                       ← Completed changes (audit trail)
        └── 2026-02-16-fix-auth/
```

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** The recommended mode is `engram`, which requires the [Engram MCP server](https://github.com/gentleman-programming/engram) to be installed and active in your tool. Without it, the system silently falls back to `none` — nothing persists and recovery after context compaction is not possible. **Install Engram before proceeding**, or use `openspec` mode as a file-based fallback.

### 1. Install the skills

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gentleman-programming/agent-teams-lite.git
cd agent-teams-lite
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer asks which tool you use and copies skills to the right location.

### 2. Add the orchestrator to your agent

See [Installation](#installation) for your specific tool.

### 3. Use it

Open your AI assistant in any project and say:

```
/sdd-init
```

Then start building:

```
/sdd-new add-csv-export
```

Or let it detect automatically — describe a substantial feature and the orchestrator will suggest SDD.

---

## Releases

We publish versioned release notes on GitHub:

- https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/agent-teams-lite/releases

Latest release:

- `v3.0.5` — Lean orchestrator prompts across all agents, reduced always-loaded prompt footprint, and standardized `_shared` install steps.

## Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sdd-init` | Initialize SDD context. Detects stack and bootstraps the active persistence backend. |
| `/sdd-explore <topic>` | Investigate an idea. Reads codebase, compares approaches. No files created. |
| `/sdd-new <name>` | Start a new change by delegating exploration + proposal to sub-agents. |
| `/sdd-continue` | Run the next dependency-ready phase via sub-agent(s). |
| `/sdd-ff <name>` | Fast-forward planning with sub-agents (proposal → specs → design → tasks). |
| `/sdd-apply` | Implement tasks in batches. Checks off items as it goes. |
| `/sdd-verify` | Validate implementation against specs. Reports CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION. |
| `/sdd-archive` | Close a change and persist final state in the active artifact store. |

### Example Flow

```
You: /sdd-new add-dark-mode

AI:  Launching explorer sub-agent...
     ✓ Codebase analyzed. React + Tailwind detected.
     ✓ Current theme: hardcoded light mode in globals.css
     
     Launching proposal sub-agent...
     ✓ proposal.md created
       Intent: Add dark mode toggle with system preference detection
       Scope: Theme context, toggle component, CSS variables
     
     Want me to continue with specs and design? (or review the proposal first)

You: Go ahead

AI:  ✓ specs/ui/spec.md — 3 requirements, 7 scenarios
     ✓ design.md — CSS variables approach, React Context, localStorage
     ✓ tasks.md — 3 phases, 8 tasks
     
     Ready to implement. Run /sdd-apply to start.

You: /sdd-apply

AI:  Implementing Phase 1 (Foundation)...
     ✓ 1.1 Created ThemeContext
     ✓ 1.2 Added CSS custom properties
     ✓ 1.3 Added localStorage persistence
     
     3/8 tasks complete. Continue with Phase 2?
```

## The Sub-Agents

Each sub-agent is a SKILL.md file — pure Markdown instructions that any AI assistant can follow.

| Sub-Agent | Skill File | What It Does |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Init** | `sdd-init/SKILL.md` | Detects project stack, creates `openspec/` structure |
| **Explorer** | `sdd-explore/SKILL.md` | Reads codebase, compares approaches, identifies risks |
| **Proposer** | `sdd-propose/SKILL.md` | Creates `proposal.md` with intent, scope, rollback plan |
| **Spec Writer** | `sdd-spec/SKILL.md` | Writes delta specs (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED) with Given/When/Then |
| **Designer** | `sdd-design/SKILL.md` | Creates `design.md` with architecture decisions and rationale |
| **Task Planner** | `sdd-tasks/SKILL.md` | Breaks down into phased, numbered task checklist |
| **Implementer** | `sdd-apply/SKILL.md` | Writes code following specs and design, marks tasks complete. v2.0: TDD workflow support |
| **Verifier** | `sdd-verify/SKILL.md` | Validates implementation against specs with real test execution. v2.0: spec compliance matrix |
| **Archiver** | `sdd-archive/SKILL.md` | Merges delta specs into main specs, moves to archive |

### Shared Conventions

All 9 skills reference three shared convention files in `skills/_shared/` instead of inlining persistence logic. This removes duplication and ensures consistent behavior across the entire workflow.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `persistence-contract.md` | Mode resolution rules — how `engram`, `openspec`, and `none` modes behave, what each mode reads/writes, and the fallback policy |
| `engram-convention.md` | Deterministic artifact naming (`sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}`), two-step recovery protocol (search then get full content), and write/update patterns via `topic_key` upserts |
| `openspec-convention.md` | Filesystem paths for each artifact, directory structure, config.yaml reference, and archive layout |

**Why they exist:**
- **DRY** — Previously each skill inlined its own persistence logic (~224 lines of duplication across 9 skills). Now each skill references the shared files.
- **Deterministic recovery** — Engram artifact naming follows a strict `sdd/{change}/{type}` convention with `topic_key`, so any skill can reliably find artifacts created by other skills without fuzzy search.
- **Consistent mode behavior** — All skills resolve `engram | openspec | none` the same way. `openspec` is never chosen automatically.

### v2.0 Skill Upgrades

Two skills received major upgrades:

- **sdd-apply v2.0** — Added TDD workflow support. When enabled (via `openspec/config.yaml` or orchestrator config), the implementer follows a RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle: write a failing test first, implement until it passes, then refactor. Controlled by `tdd: true` and `test_command` in config.
- **sdd-verify v2.0** — Now performs real test execution instead of static analysis only. Runs the project's test suite and build commands, produces a spec compliance matrix mapping each requirement to PASS/FAIL/SKIP, and reports issues at CRITICAL/WARNING/SUGGESTION severity levels. Configurable via `test_command`, `build_command`, and `coverage_threshold`.

### Claude Code

**1. Copy skills:**

```bash
# Using the install script
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose option 1: Claude Code

# Or manually
cp -r skills/_shared skills/sdd-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**2. Add orchestrator to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:**

Append the contents of [`examples/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`](examples/claude-code/CLAUDE.md) to your existing `CLAUDE.md`.

The example is intentionally lean to avoid token bloat in always-loaded system prompts. Detailed persistence and artifact rules live in `~/.claude/skills/_shared/*.md`.

This keeps your existing assistant identity and adds SDD as an orchestration overlay.

The orchestrator instructions teach Claude Code to:
- Detect SDD triggers (`/sdd-new`, feature descriptions, etc.)
- Launch sub-agents via the Task tool
- Pass skill file paths so sub-agents read their instructions
- Track state between phases

**3. Verify:**

Open Claude Code and type `/sdd-init` — it should recognize the command.

---

### OpenCode

**1. Copy skills and commands:**

```bash
# Using the install script (installs both skills + commands)
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose option 2: OpenCode

# Or manually
cp -r skills/_shared skills/sdd-* ~/.config/opencode/skills/
cp examples/opencode/commands/sdd-*.md ~/.config/opencode/commands/
```

**2. Add orchestrator agent to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:**

Merge the `agent` block from [`examples/opencode/opencode.json`](examples/opencode/opencode.json) into your existing config.

You can either:
- **Add it to your existing agent** (e.g., append SDD orchestrator instructions to your primary agent's prompt)
- **Create a dedicated agent** (copy the `sdd-orchestrator` agent definition as-is)

Recommended OpenCode setup:
- Keep your everyday assistant (e.g., `gentleman`) as `primary`
- Set `sdd-orchestrator` to `all`
- Select `sdd-orchestrator` only when you want SDD workflows

**3. Verify:**

Open OpenCode and type `/sdd-init` — it should recognize the command.

How to use in OpenCode:
- Start OpenCode in your project: `opencode .`
- Use the agent picker (Tab) and choose `sdd-orchestrator`
- Run SDD commands: `/sdd-init`, `/sdd-new <name>`, `/sdd-apply`, etc.
- Commands are installed at `~/.config/opencode/commands/` and auto-discovered by OpenCode
- Switch back to your normal agent (Tab) for day-to-day coding

---

### Gemini CLI

**1. Copy skills:**

```bash
# Using the install script
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose Gemini CLI option

# Or manually
cp -r skills/_shared skills/sdd-* ~/.gemini/skills/
```

**2. Add orchestrator to `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`:**

Append the contents of [`examples/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md`](examples/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md) to your Gemini system prompt file (create it if it doesn't exist).

Make sure `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=1` is set in `~/.gemini/.env` so Gemini loads the system prompt.

**3. Verify:**

Open Gemini CLI and type `/sdd-init` — it should recognize the command.

> **Note:** Gemini CLI doesn't have a native Task tool for sub-agent delegation. The skills work as inline instructions — the orchestrator reads them directly rather than spawning fresh-context sub-agents. For the best sub-agent experience, use Claude Code or OpenCode.

---

### Codex

**1. Copy skills:**

```bash
# Using the install script
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose Codex option

# Or manually
cp -r skills/_shared skills/sdd-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

**2. Add orchestrator instructions:**

Add the orchestrator instructions to `~/.codex/agents.md` (or your `model_instructions_file` if configured).

**3. Verify:**

Open Codex and type `/sdd-init`.

> **Note:** Like Gemini CLI, Codex runs skills inline rather than as true sub-agents. The planning phases (proposal, spec, design, tasks) still work well; implementation batching is handled by the orchestrator instructions.

---

### VS Code (Copilot)

VS Code Copilot supports agent mode with skill files. Skills are read by the agent as context files. Note: VS Code does not support the Task tool so phases run inline (no fresh-context sub-agents).

**1. Install skills:**

```bash
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose option 5 — VS Code
```

This copies skills to `.github/skills/` in your current project directory.

**2. Add orchestrator instructions:**

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project (if it doesn't exist) and paste in the orchestrator from [`examples/vscode/copilot-instructions.md`](examples/vscode/copilot-instructions.md):

```bash
cp examples/vscode/copilot-instructions.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

VS Code Copilot automatically reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as project-level instructions. No settings changes required.

**3. Verify:**

Open VS Code, open the Chat panel (Ctrl+Cmd+I / Ctrl+Alt+I), select **Agent** mode, and type `/sdd-init`.

> **Note:** VS Code Copilot supports agent mode with tool use. Skills work as context files in `.github/skills/`. For true sub-agent delegation with fresh context windows, use Claude Code, OpenCode, or GitHub Copilot CLI.

---

### GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub Copilot CLI is a terminal-native AI assistant with **full sub-agent delegation** via `/fleet`. Unlike VS Code Copilot (which runs skills inline), Copilot CLI spawns parallel sub-agents — each with fresh context — just like Claude Code and OpenCode. It also supports autopilot mode, `/plan` mode, infinite sessions, and `/delegate` for cloud-based async work.

**1. Install skills and Engram instructions:**

```bash
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose option 6 — GitHub Copilot CLI
```

This copies skills to `.github/skills/` and installs the Engram memory protocol to `.github/instructions/engram.instructions.md`. Copilot CLI auto-discovers both locations.

**2. Add orchestrator instructions:**

```bash
cp examples/copilot-cli/copilot-instructions.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Or for auto-discovery without modifying `copilot-instructions.md`, copy `AGENTS.md` to your project root:

```bash
cp examples/copilot-cli/AGENTS.md AGENTS.md
```

Copilot CLI reads instructions in this order: `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` (global) → `.github/copilot-instructions.md` → `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` → `AGENTS.md`.

**3. Verify:**

```bash
copilot  # Start Copilot CLI in your project
```

Then type `/sdd-init`. For complex features, consider starting in plan mode (press `Shift+Tab`) before running `/sdd-new`.

**Using `/fleet` for parallel SDD phases:**

```
/fleet Run two sub-agents in parallel:
1. Read .github/skills/sdd-spec/SKILL.md and run the Spec Writer for change "add-dark-mode"
2. Read .github/skills/sdd-design/SKILL.md and run the Designer for change "add-dark-mode"
```

**Using autopilot for sdd-apply:**

```bash
# Start with all permissions, 10-step limit
copilot --autopilot --yolo --max-autopilot-continues 10
# Then: /sdd-apply add-dark-mode
```

- Use `/new` or `/clear` between unrelated changes to keep context focused
- Check session state with `/session`, view checkpoints with `/session checkpoints`
- Use `/delegate` to offload tangential tasks (docs, separate refactors) asynchronously
- After context compaction, SDD state recovers automatically from Engram

> **Note:** GitHub Copilot CLI has full sub-agent support via `/fleet` (parallel phases with fresh context), autopilot mode, and infinite sessions. The Engram memory protocol (`.github/instructions/engram.instructions.md`) is auto-loaded by Copilot CLI, enabling SDD state to survive context compaction and `/compact` operations.

[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) is Google's AI-first IDE with native skill support. It has its own skill and rule system separate from VS Code.

**1. Copy skills:**

```bash
# Global (available across all projects)
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose Antigravity option

# Or manually (global)
cp -r skills/_shared skills/sdd-* ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/

# Workspace-specific (per project)
mkdir -p .agent/skills
cp -r skills/_shared skills/sdd-* .agent/skills/
```

**2. Add orchestrator instructions:**

Add the SDD orchestrator as a global rule in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, or create a workspace rule in `.agent/rules/sdd-orchestrator.md`.

See [`examples/antigravity/sdd-orchestrator.md`](examples/antigravity/sdd-orchestrator.md) for the rule content.

**3. Verify:**

Open Antigravity and type `/sdd-init` in the agent panel.

> **Note:** Antigravity uses `.agent/skills/` and `.agent/rules/` for workspace config, and `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` for global. It does NOT use `.vscode/` paths.

### Cursor

**1. Install skills globally:**

```bash
./scripts/install.sh  # Choose option 7: Cursor
```

This installs to `~/.cursor/skills/` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\skills\` (Windows). The `.cursorrules` example references this global path via `~/.cursor/skills/_shared/`.

**2. Add orchestrator to `.cursorrules`:**

Append the contents of [`examples/cursor/.cursorrules`](examples/cursor/.cursorrules) to your project's `.cursorrules` file.

**Note:** Cursor doesn't have a Task tool for true sub-agent delegation. The skills still work — Cursor reads them as instructions — but the orchestrator runs inline rather than delegating to fresh-context sub-agents. For the best sub-agent experience, use Claude Code, OpenCode, or GitHub Copilot CLI.

---

### Other Tools

The skills are pure Markdown. Any AI assistant that can read files can use them.

**1. Copy skills** to wherever your tool reads instructions from.

**2. Add orchestrator instructions** to your tool's system prompt or rules file.

**3. Adapt the sub-agent pattern:**
- If your tool has a Task/sub-agent mechanism → use the pattern from `examples/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`
- If your tool has `/fleet` or similar parallel delegation → adapt `examples/copilot-cli/copilot-instructions.md`
- If not → the orchestrator reads the skills inline (still works, just uses more context)

## Why Not Just Use OpenSpec?

[OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev) is great. We took heavy inspiration from it. But:

| | OpenSpec | Agent Teams Lite |
|---|---|---|
| **Dependencies** | Requires `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec` | Zero. Pure Markdown files. |
| **Sub-agents** | Runs inline (one context window) | True sub-agent delegation (fresh context per phase) |
| **Context usage** | Everything in one conversation | Orchestrator stays lightweight, sub-agents get fresh context |
| **Customization** | Edit YAML schemas + rebuild | Edit Markdown files, instant effect |
| **Tool support** | 20+ tools via CLI | Any tool that can read Markdown (infinite) |
| **Setup** | CLI init + slash commands | Copy files + go |

**The key difference is the sub-agent architecture.** OpenSpec runs everything in a single conversation context. Agent Teams Lite uses the Task tool to spawn fresh-context sub-agents, keeping the orchestrator's context window clean.

This means:
- Less context compression = fewer hallucinations
- Each sub-agent gets focused instructions = better output quality
- Orchestrator stays lightweight = can handle longer feature development sessions

## Concepts

### Delta Specs

Instead of rewriting entire specs, changes describe what's different:

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: CSV Export
The system SHALL support exporting data to CSV format.

#### Scenario: Export all observations
- GIVEN the user has observations stored
- WHEN the user requests CSV export
- THEN a CSV file is generated with all observations
- AND column headers match the observation fields

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Data Export
The system SHALL support multiple export formats.
(Previously: The system SHALL support JSON export.)
```

When the change is archived, these deltas merge into the main specs automatically.

### RFC 2119 Keywords

Specs use standardized language for requirement strength:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **MUST / SHALL** | Absolute requirement |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended, exceptions may exist |
| **MAY** | Optional |

### The Archive Cycle

```
1. Specs describe current behavior
2. Changes propose modifications (as deltas)
3. Implementation makes changes real
4. Archive merges deltas into specs
5. Specs now describe the new behavior
6. Next change builds on updated specs
```
